    <h2 class="section-subheading">Where will it be held? What about Covid-19?</h2>
    <p class="section-content">
      Our original plan for the internship was to have all interns work out of our Bangalore office, facilitating in-depth interaction with members of nilenso. However, in light of the ongoing pandemic and related lockdown/quarantines, it is most likely that the internship will be fully remote. We are closely monitoring the situation and will post updates as we know more.
    </p>

    <p class="section-content">
      To support a fully remote internship we require candidates to have access to their own computer along with a decent internet connection. We will provide support in terms of any software tools or licenses required.
