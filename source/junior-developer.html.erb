    <p class="section-content">
      We are a boutique consulting firm based in Bangalore (though we are fully remote at the moment and our members are
      free to work from any location of their choice), structured as an employee-owned cooperative. Together, we’re
      building an open, inclusive company.
    </p>
    <p class="section-content">
      To us, programming is not just a job. We care deeply about the craft of creation, and the impact we make in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p class="section-content">
      We are tool agnostic, and are currently building software in Clojure as well as Haskell, Elixir, Ruby/Rails,
      Python,
      Go, and Javascript. We incorporated in 2013, have a steady track record of doing deeply technical work. Check out
      our website to see who we’ve worked with, and the <a target="_blank" href="talks.html">talks</a> we’ve given at conferences in India and around the world.

    <h2 class="section-heading">🗓 What the job involves</h2>
    <p class="section-content">
      You will likely spend the first few months learning and building the necessary skills to work on real world
      projects. We’ll guide you through learning functional programming, Clojure, web development, project management,
      review your code, and strive to provide you continuous feedback.

      Once on a project, you’ll ramp up on any unknown tech stack, and work with more senior people at nilenso and the
      clients to develop products end to end. Your primary responsibilities on the project will be to:
    </p>
    <div class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>Work with the product, design, and other teams on the client side to decide what needs to be built, and when
        </li>
        <li>Break down stories, and create a backlog of work for yourself</li>
        <li>Pair with developers at nilenso and the client to write code, tests, and review PRs</li>
        <li>Design, develop, deploy, and ensure reliability of the software you write</li>
        <li>Triage and fix bugs, as well as some production issues</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="section-content">
      Everyone at nilenso is expected to participate in the running of the company in one way or another, based on
      interest
      and ability. Once you have learned the ropes of working on client projects, you too will be encouraged to
      contribute
      to internal company activities and projects. That said, everything is transparent at nilenso, so even while
      ramping
      up, you will be welcome to participate in discussions and understand how we run ourselves.
