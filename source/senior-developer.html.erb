      We are an 8 year old boutique technology consulting firm. We care about the impact that we make in the world.
      As an employee-owned cooperative, we all are stakeholders in how nilenso is run and can prioritise employee
      happiness: we don’t need to justify how happy employees impact the bottom line. We’re currently a fully remote
      team of friendly people across India with one member in Canada, and are hiring folks based in either of these
      geographies.

      <ul>
        <li>We want to work on hard technical problems, and have a track record of doing deeply technical work.
          We have designed, built, and delivered complex, distributed, scalable backend systems for the web that
          have stood the test of time. You can read about some of our
          <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/media/blob/master/presentations/generic-client-deck/nilenso-deck.pdf">projects</a>,

        <li>
          We are product engineers. We collaborate with business, product, data science, design and other
          engineering teams to figure out the whys, whats and hows of product. We understand trade-offs.
        </li>
        <li>
          We build teams. We make incremental improvements to processes, upskill the people we work with,
          maintain open lines of communication, and build long lasting client relationships.
        </li>
        <li>
          We create high level designs, write ADRs / Tech specs / PRDs where necessary, break them down
          into user stories, pair on building and writing tests, take things into production, and iterate.
        </li>
        <li>
          We have written production code in Clojure/ClojureScript, Haskell, Elixir, Ruby/Rails, Python,
          Go, and Javascript, and are partial to a functional approach to programming.
        </li>
        <li>
          While every project is a little different, all our engineers, regardless of seniority, ship code,
          and are responsible for keeping it running in production.
