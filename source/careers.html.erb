<div class="bordered-section">
  <h2 class="section-heading">What we work on</h2>
  <p class="section-content">
    We write Clojure / ClojureScript, Elixir, Go with a dash of Haskell
    /PureScript, Javascript, Java and Ruby / Rails, in the places those languages make sense.
  </p>

  <p class="section-content">
    We've spent significant time scaling and squeezing runtime performance out of Postgres and
    analytics performance out of HBase and Redshift.
  </p>

  <p class="section-content">
    Most of our code is on the backend, and it makes a lot of sense to us to write backend code in a
    LISP on the JVM, but we're not wedded to it. "Best tool for the job" applies at nilenso -- but
    the "best" tool needs to be quantified with facts. We love facts. We might be knee-deep in Swift
    or Rust or C (who knows) next year and we're looking for other open-minded developers to share
    their excitement with us.

  <p class="section-content">
    Last year amidst COVID-19, we became a
    <a target="_blank" href="https://vyakaran.nilenso.com/office/being-remote">fully remote</a> company. People are
    working from their home offices, or
    anywhere, really. We might open up an office again when it is safe, though folks will have the option to continue
    working from home if they prefer that. If there’s a way we can make your work experience more comfortable or fun,
    we’ll do it.
