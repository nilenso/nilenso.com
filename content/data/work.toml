    <p class="text-black text-base leading-normal  md:text-xl lg:text-2xl md:leading-snug font-light text-black">     Even to begin with, this involved building a real-time quiz coupled with the event where hundreds of thousands of participants needed to see the questions at the exact same time. </p>

    <p class="text-black text-base leading-normal  md:text-xl lg:text-2xl md:leading-snug font-light pb-4 md:pb-7">Designed and implemented a fault-tolerant distributed system in Elixir, and Erlang's OTP tooling.

    <p class="text-black text-base leading-normal  md:text-xl lg:text-2xl md:leading-snug font-light pb-4 md:pb-7"> Built a Mob Simulator, that simulated concurrent users ordering in the hundreds of thousands, to load test the system.</p>
