  <p class="text-black text-base leading-normal  md:text-xl lg:text-xl md:leading-snug font-light pb-4 md:pb-7">
    Siri is like a tangerine - sweet, with a colourful yet tough exterior. You might have seen her in a coffee-fueled euphoria, zipping through the city on her e-bike to play board games.
    As the Citrus Coder, she loves building massively scalable microservices and participating in PR reviews.
    She aspires to travel the world someday, digging into the sights, smells and tastes of the fruit bowl that is human culture.
