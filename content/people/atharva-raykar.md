  Atharva has always looked up to practitioners and craftsmen. In his college days, he helped build an Open Source community of tinkerers to relieve himself from the misery of sitting in lectures.

  His foray into Open Source continued with his contributions to the Git project, where he honed his craft with gnarly C and email patches. While at nilenso, he has worked with Dunzo to revamp their core partner-side systems.

  When he isn't debugging like a stoic, he is usually found writing blogs appreciating Comic Sans, creating grimy digital art, or making questionable beats with Indian truck horns and autotuned baby sounds.
