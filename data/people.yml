    <p>A self-taught programmer, Aditya loves to learn and to share his knowledge. He has designed and taught workshops at Functional Conf, IN/Clojure, LambdaWorld (Seattle), and for staff education at work. He's partial to Functional Programming, and thus far he's made things using Clojure, Ansible, Terraform, some Kotlin, and a generous dash of Bash.</p>
    <p>He uses both Emacs and Vim, but mainly Emacs ;)</p>
    <p>Aditya is too cool for social media.</p>

    <p>Kitty started writing code with Borland Turbo C++ and Visual Basic in high-school, but then quickly moved to Ruby when he discovered <a href='http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/'>_why's poignant guide</a>. He was a part of GSOC'2011, and contributed to <a href='http://live.gnome.org/AkshayGupta_GnomeShell_Document'>GNOME</a>.</p>
    <p>Since then, he has hacked a fair bit of Ruby, consulted on a variety of Ruby on Rails projects, and helped build <a href='http://rubymonk.com'>RubyMonk</a>.</p>
    <p>He loves cycling, listening to noise rock, and has recently re-discovered his fondness for Snakeboarding.</p>

    <p>Like a rock. Which is to say, she has tenacity. Not the way a Ford is "like a rock". Deepa drives. One supposes a Ford drives, too. But Deepa will outlast even a gas guzzler from the 60's. So she's more like a rock than a ford. In both ways.</p>
    <p>Deepa's got a rainbow-coloured past. Starting startups, running businesses, crunching big numbers, building robots, and tearing up backroads in a cloud of dust that implies the closing credits will scroll by soon with a really kickin' outtro. At nilenso, she's tasked with figuring out how to turn us from a cute little boutique software consultancy into a dominant multinational co-operative corporation. No big deal.</p>
    <p>Deepa is a stealth semi-luddite, so don't be surprised if she convinces you your smartphone is not the future of your life -- or that data expiry and encryption should be an everyday concern. Oh, she also speaks half a dozen languages and knows everyone you know but she is almost definitely probably not a secret agent.</p>

  name: "Govind Joshi"
  bio: >
    <p>Govind will never assault you with words, but he is always listening intently to what you have to say... which is often a pleasant counterbalance to the rest of us. One doesn't usually consider thoughtful and considered commentary an essential skill, but he has a way of making it appear so.</p>
    <p>Govind is actually a Biologist in disguise. He's spent most of his career in BioTech and found his way into hardcore software development through an inherent love of Category Theory and Haskell.</p>
    <p>If you see Govind riding his bicycle around town to get to a local classical music performance, we suggest you follow him.</p>

   <p>Nivedita joined nilenso straight after finishing her engineering in computer science. She learned programming by building a school project in C++. Fortunately, C++ didn't have as adverse an impact on her as one would imagine. She loves learning new stuff, knits a lot and can these days be seen writing Clojure with great happiness.</p>

  bio: "<p>Shafeeq's quiet confidence and smiling demeanor belie an ember of passion searing just beneath the surface. When he first joined us, he was loath to engage the ethically treacherous Java ecosystem and longed for the purity of Python. He is no fan of Oracle, no fan of yesteryear's software meatgrinder, and no fan of ignorance. Neither are we.</p>
    <p>To that end, we traded him an unlimited library, which he chews through like an industrial tree harvester, for a tempered approach to Free Software. He now builds software with Clojure and ClojureScript with the same passion we first saw in him.</p>"
