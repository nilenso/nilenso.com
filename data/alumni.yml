  name: "Aninda Kundu"
  bio: >
    <p>Aninda graduated from BIT Mesra, with a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering which he traded in favor of a life in programming. He started his career in HP where he spent 4 years learning how not to build software on the .NET platform (which he still loves).</p>
    <p>He delved into the world of startups where he was able to make a leap of faith into the world of TDD, REST, MVC, DRY, YAGNI, Git, ROR, and other abbreviated coolness. He fell in love with software again, gravitated to a deep appreciation of agile philosophies, and vows not to leave home without it.</p>
    <p>Aninda is passionate about building elegant working software, and wanted to work with people who are too, when Nilenso answered his call.</p>

      <p>
        Asif joined Nilenso after spending two years at MobME Wireless where he dabbled in telephony, picked up Ruby, and helped build the systems that powered a large-scale mobile content subscription service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the year and a half at Nilenso, he consulted on Rails projects including a private social network and a virtual phone system. He's grown fond of pair-programming, TDD, and even Javascript (only with frameworks, mind you) during this time. He believes <a href='people.html#steven'>Steven Deobald</a> when he says Clojure is the next big thing, and hopes to deep dive into all the functional awesomeness soon.

    <p>Jithu has been developing web applications for over half a decade, writing mostly in Java and Ruby. He is trying to catch up with the frenzy of NodeJS lately, and makes an effort to not clench teeth when exposed to the wonders of Javascript. </p>
    <p>When the internet goes down, you can find him hunched with a pair of binoculars, either observing birds or stars depending on the time of the day. He enjoys cycling and wishes to busk with a melodica some day.</p>

    Smit would like to tell you about TLA+. Not interested? That's cool. What's your favourite consensus algorithm? Do you want a coffee? Blue Tokai or Blue Bottle? Here you go.
    Are you also concerned with the depths of your consciousness as it pertains to GTD? Let's reflect on our habits so we can see the truth underneath our behaviours which carve the future of distributed computing architecture. Want another coffee?

  name: "Timothy Andrew"
  bio: >
    <p>Timothy has been vaguely passionate about computers ever since he got all the way through Prince of Persia when he was five. This grew into a legitimate love for the field after he crashed his Windows box in 2007, and managed a fragile triple-boot system that included a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86">patched version of OS X</a>.</p>
    <p>Over the past year at nilenso, he has learned Rails, helped build a suite of three <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-survey-web">web</a>/<a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-survey-mobile">mobile</a> <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-user-owner">apps</a> for a non-profit, and worked on <a href="http://wikenso.com/">Wikenso</a>.</p>
    <p>When he's not glued to a screen of some sort, he's introverted to a fault, likes to jam on the bass guitar, and play snooker.</p>
