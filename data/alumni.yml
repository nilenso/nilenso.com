    <p>Abhinav is the crust of the litter, you know? Old school JVM hacker. Loves log files. Wishes he was programming Haskell. The usual.</p>
    <p>Big data projects were his thing, but we ripped him from his comfortable Cave of Analysis and shoved him into a world of Clojure and Emacs. He's never stopped thanking us.</p>
    <p>He would love it if you'd go for a long bicycle ride to Mysore with him tomorrow. Bring some of those little bananas.</p>

  bio: >
    <p>Aninda graduated from BIT Mesra, with a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering which he traded in favor of a life in programming. He started his career in HP where he spent 4 years learning how not to build software on the .NET platform (which he still loves).</p>
    <p>He delved into the world of startups where he was able to make a leap of faith into the world of TDD, REST, MVC, DRY, YAGNI, Git, ROR, and other abbreviated coolness. He fell in love with software again, gravitated to a deep appreciation of agile philosophies, and vows not to leave home without it.</p>
    <p>Aninda is passionate about building elegant working software, and wanted to work with people who are too, when Nilenso answered his call.</p>

        Asif joined Nilenso after spending two years at MobME Wireless where he dabbled in telephony, picked up Ruby, and helped build the systems that powered a large-scale mobile content subscription service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the year and a half at Nilenso, he consulted on Rails projects including a private social network and a virtual phone system. He's grown fond of pair-programming, TDD, and even Javascript (only with frameworks, mind you) during this time. He believes <a href='people.html#steven'>Steven Deobald</a> when he says Clojure is the next big thing, and hopes to deep dive into all the functional awesomeness soon.

    <p>Timothy has been vaguely passionate about computers ever since he got all the way through Prince of Persia when he was five. This grew into a legitimate love for the field after he crashed his Windows box in 2007, and managed a fragile triple-boot system that included a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86">patched version of OS X</a>.</p>
    <p>Over the past years at nilenso, he learned Rails, helped build a suite of three <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-survey-web">web</a>/<a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-survey-mobile">mobile</a> <a href="https://github.com/nilenso/ashoka-user-owner">apps</a> for a non-profit, and worked on <a href="http://wikenso.com/">Wikenso</a>.</p>
    <p>When he's not glued to a screen of some sort, he's introverted to a fault, likes to jam on the bass guitar, and play snooker.</p>

  bio: "In the life of human beings, there is dissatisfaction on the right and gratitude on the left. Frustration and discontent cannot last and will, given enough time, always give way to gentleness and purpose. Unni, like all of us, is forever traversing this bridge. Coarse and sharp is the boredom of working for multinational corporations, building Yet Another CRM for an unknown customer to who-knows-what-end. Finer and softer come the challenges halfway across the bridge: Can I find the same joy in GoLang that I find in LISP? If the bridge is rigid and swaying, how soft and light on my feet must I be to maintain my balance? Is it true that the smoothest loop drawn on the surface of the Earth by my motorcycle contains every secret to the Universe? If I am grateful now for this slice of pizza, what possible discontent could disturb me from an unlived future? Have I crossed the bridge or have I become the bridge?"
