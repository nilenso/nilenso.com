                        <p>Alisha is Neo incarnate; she visualises the world in code. She was first drawn to programming because of how logical it was. Today, she is driven by the idea that the code she writes can make a difference in someone's life.</p>
                        <p>Alisha is an open source enthusiast. As an Outreachy intern, she worked on the <a href='http://fedoraproject.org'>Fedora project</a>. Since then, she has been a <a href='https://codein.withgoogle.com'>Google Code-In</a> mentor, <a href='https://www.girlscript.tech/home'>GirlScript</a> mentor, helping new folks get acquainted with working on open source projects, guiding them with beginner-friendly resources, as well as reviewing PRs. She loves introducing people (and women in particular) to programming, and has spoken at various conferences. Alisha is a big believer in the power of community.</p>
                        <p>Alisha joined us with experience working at <a href='https://uncopied.art/fr/about'>uncopied.art</a> and Accenture.</p>
                        <p>She loves music, and can be seen strumming the ukulele to her favourite songs. She is partial to old Bollywood songs, though lofi is her latest goto. :)</p>

                        <p>Deepa's got a rainbow-coloured past. Founding startups, running businesses, crunching big numbers, building robots, and tearing up backroads in a cloud of dust that implies the closing credits will scroll by soon with a really kickin' outtro.

                        <p>Deepa is a stealth semi-luddite, so don't be surprised if she convinces you your smartphone is not the future of your life -- or that data expiry and encryption should be an everyday concern. Oh, she also speaks half a dozen languages and knows everyone you know but she is almost definitely probably not a secret agent.</p>
