            </li>
            <li>
                We build teams. We make incremental improvements to processes, upskill the people we work with, maintain open lines of communication, and

            </li>
            <li>
                You have one or two programming languages under your belt that you are very comfortable in. You can reflect on the language runtime,
                developer ecosystem, choice of libraries, and quality of code and tests.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can reason about systems holistically, taking into account maintainability, speed of delivery, and performance goals.
            </li>
            <li>
                You are comfortable ramping up on unfamiliar tech stacks, digging into legacy codebases, identifying the good, bad and ugly parts of a
                codebase and making improvements incrementally.
            </li>
            <li>You have mentored folks either formally through training or informally, while working with them.</li>
