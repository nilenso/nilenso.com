  <div class="section-content">
    Some of the major services we've built include a multivariate testing/experimentation platform, a rideshare driver-allocation service, multiple machine learning runtimes, and a variety of ETL and analytics systems. We always maintain and operate systems we build when they go to production. Most of these systems are written in Clojure but we also have Java, JRuby, Go, Javascript (node.js) and Haskell in production.
  </div>

  <p class="section-content">
    <strong>Driver Allocation Service:</strong> This service was built for an Indonesian Uber competitor. Matching drivers to riders is perhaps the most crucial runtime behaviour of any rideshare business. This is the first interaction any customer will have with the application. It is also the most common. Failures quickly multiply in the minds of users (riders and drivers, both). We were tasked with rewriting a fragile and bug-ridden Allocation Service written in Go. For this project, we convinced the client to use Clojure, deploying their first production Clojure code. The rewrite runtime consisted of (approximately) 2500 lines of Clojure, as opposed to 3500 lines of Go. Interestingly, 1500 lines of Go tests became 2000 lines of Clojure tests. Our testing strategy for this project was significant: We eschewed the standard unit testing suite for a completely generative test suite, written in Clojure's <span class="mono">test.check</span>, a port of Haskell's <span class="mono">QuickCheck</span>. Our generative test suite ran hundreds of different tests in developer's environments and thousands of different tests in the continuous integration environment, growing our confidence over the original codebase by an order of magnitude. Thanks to generative testing (and a tiny unit test suite for edge cases), our rewrite was deployed with zero issues on its first day in production. The service runs behind load-balancing circuit breakers which have, thus far, proven resilient enough to ensure the comprehensive monitoring we built into the service has not been necessary.<br>

    We've given a presentation on the journey of this rewrite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7xzH8jB8A" target="_blank">here</a>.

  <p class="section-content">
    <strong>Experimentation Platform:</strong> This is easily the largest system nilenso has built and owned. With a three-year lifespan thus far, EP supports a <10ms 99.9 percentile SLA and over 500 requests per second as a backend service to a large e-commerce company. The system involved significant research and the incorporation of work done by Google, Netflix, and Microsoft (released as white papers), tuning a large and fast-moving Postgres runtime database as well as a sizable reporting database. Distribution and failover were a major concern from the beginning, and the service instances have withheld substantial changes in load on occasions such as Black Friday and "Cyber Monday". Additional snapshotting and redundancy for the system is built on top of ZFS.<br>

     We've given a presentation on EP's architecture: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjfXhhxw9Bs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/YjfXhhxw9Bs</a>

  <p class="section-content">
    <strong>Machine Learning runtimes:</strong> These systems have evolved a great deal since we began working on them. Initially, they were built on top of an HBase reporting backend using an internal distributed parallelization framework and inter-process communication was primarily managed with RabbitMQ. These days, the reporting is done off of AWS Redshift and most systems communicate via internal REST APIs or Kafka, where appropriate. The external APIs are exposed over Google protocol buffers for serialization efficiency and because they make more sense as strictly-schema'd RPC-style APIs than representational APIs. Part of this work was picking apart the client's original machine learning monolith, another significant portion was coming up with a generative testing harness and framework (QAs write selenium tests, the development team uses Causatum+Simulant+Datomic). Most of the development was on runtimes, not algorithms, but for the recommendations engine (email marketing for existing customers) we did implement Multi-armed Bandit. Performance and load testing was an ongoing activity for all of these services, though some of the load testing driver was written in bare Java rather than Clojure, to maintain control of garbage collection (primarily for histograms of load).
  </p>
  <p class="section-content">
    <strong>ETL, data warehousing, and analytics:</strong> Transformation of streaming events into an OLAP db was done on three projects: for e-commerce (session, purchase, clickstream data), media (clickstream and mutative events), and an events management company (financial data, clickstream). The first two were done in Clojure and Haskell, the last in node.js. These systems were variously about transforming disparate data into a single schema, rendering realtime analytics dashboards, and providing notifications to business users around key metrics.
  </p>
  <p class="section-content">
    <strong>Web crawler/scraper:</strong> A system which would routinely analyze an unstructured dataset on the web to correlate data from internal systems with external. This project employed a great deal of error-handling, distribution of the agents performing the crawling, and intelligent HTML parsing.
  </p>
  <p class="section-content">
    <strong>Monitoring:</strong>We have built a complete monitoring solution for the e-commerce service architectures we help support. System-level events and application events are both centrally collected in an on-box service running adjacent to runtime services then queried periodically into Prometheus to provide intelligent alerting to developers doing operations and diagnostics tools in the case of runtime failure. This work was recently open-sourced by our client and can be seen here:

    We have a number of older projects we've delivered as well, in a variety of technologies. But these are the key projects from the past year. It's also worth mentioning that we manage all our own servers, infrastructure, testing, and deployments... it's a bit difficult to capture everything we do there under one bullet point, however.

    If you are interested in some of the talks we've given at conferences in the past few years, you can look through our <a href="/talks.html">talks page</a>. These cover Clojure, Haskell, Ruby, data science, concurrency, resilient service architectures, programmatic music synthesis, our employee-owned business model, and meditation. :)
